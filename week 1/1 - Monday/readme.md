## Overview of this part of the module and biodiversity in metacommunities

The primary objective of todays work will be to introduce students to the second half of the module--modelling biodiversity--and to discuss the key concept for the week-- metacommunities. A metacommunity is just an expansion of a community (a local patch) in time and space. Coexistence in metacommunities is influenced both by local processes (e.g., competition, predation) and by regional processes (dispersal, habitat heterogeneity). Although somewhat abstract, the metacommunity concept forms the basis for thinking about the maintenance of biodiversity across space and time.

## Part 1.2. Sampling tree metacommunities in Halle Forests. (You can do this over the weekend, or anytime before 12.00 on Monday, January 8)

Objective: Observe tree species diversity (numbers of species, relative abundances) and tree species composition (names and types of trees) in multiple forests within the Halle (Saale) region. Use these observations as a basis for thinking about what influence the numbers and types of species in a given area, and how they change across space and time

Methods: Each of you should collect data from (at least) 3 different forest plots in Halle. You have to decide what a 'plot' means, but it should contain enough individual trees (e.g., at least 10, but not more than 50) so that you can calculate some metrics of diversity. For each 'plot', write down the name of the species and the number of individuals of each species that you observed in your plot. Only count species that are bigger than a 'sapling' (roughly 5 cm dbh and larger). You also have to decide what 'different' means among the 3 plots you sample.  However, I strongly suggest you try to find plots that differ in their habitat (e.g., wet/dry, hilly/flat, urban/natural), so that you can observe different kinds of trees in different kinds of habitats. Importantly, however, don't overdo it. Use good methods, but don't be overly strict about size of plot (you can use the size of your pace to measure meters).  Overall, this excercise should allow you to spend ~30 minutes per site. (For a total of 2-3 hours in the forest making observations and collecting data). 

Tree identification: You don't have to be a tree expert to recognize that there are many different types of trees in the forest. This is easy to see, even in winter.  Look at the bark, the buds of twigs, and other features (dead leaves, fruits).  If you don't know their actual species names, you can give them whatever name you like (descriptor, like gray bark, opposite leaves, etc). But do your best to differentiate species (while maintaining the need to be relatively quick). 

Strong Recommendation: Use the 'Flora Incognita' app on your smartphone.  It's developed at the MPI in Jena (and elsewhere) and uses quite good AI for plant ID. If you can't get it to species, just write the genus or some description for the species. The key is to try to tell species apart. There are also other apps that can be useful, such as iNaturalist and Seek (part of the iNaturalist project). These are all free, but there are others that cost money if you're really interested.
