# Week 2 - Teachers' debriefing
## Monday
### Candy lab

 - Roel made an Excel file for the students to fill in their samples and
 automatically get biodiversity metric back
 - The candies should be the same size or sampling is biased toward large species.
 - One bag was so uneven that the students stopped sampling
Bingo ball suggestion with chewing gums instead of marbles:

 - Each students received 3 bags, ie a whole metacommunity
 - The exercise worked well, it's well prepared
 - Some groups went as far as calculating metrics while others were still sampling
 - The fastest group was split for the next days
 - As a wrap up, Roel went back to the tree counting data to unify the learnings of the day. 
 
## Tuesday
### Morning
 - Kim focused on metric calculation, notably showing equations in a spreasheet

### Afternoon - Alpha, Beta
 - Students seemed to compute very related metrics without seeing the relation -> More focus on the links between the metrics is needed
 - alpha, beta, gamma, more on the concepts, on the sampling, on the differences on the scales
 - More on the interpretations of the metrics with empirical examples.
 
 
## Wednesday
### Morning - mobsim
 - The setup has to be easier, no `devtools` that depends on `rtools`: mobsim has to be on CRAN
 - It is imperative to check each computer at the beginning or students might hide that they actually cannot do the exercise
 - Metrics should be better integrated with the week's curriculum
 - eg distance decay is off topic for this week

### Afternoon - Project description
 - "Take 5 minutes to read the description and let's talk about it"
 - Good that we were 3 in the room on that day to be accessible
 - Walking in the room and asking them if they need anything is essential to make it easier for them to ask anything

## Thursday
### Helpdesk
## Friday
### Presentations
## Projects
 - Suggestion: 1 or 2 paper per group
 - Suggestion: Moving online to in-person helpdesk in Halle
 - Suggestion: Asking students that each has to ask 1 question to one of the other groups
 - Suggestion: Less project time and more exercises to understand the metrics ->
   - Wednesday afternoon for exercises and interpretation
     - "S does not change between treatments. PIE changes between treatments"... In which directions? The same? Why?
     - How complex can we go with master students?
     - Beta? In week 1, Whittaker is computed with alpha and gamma. In the Thompson model, Gamma is easy to determine but it's a little bit more tricky in the papers we distribute. Examples are also needed
     - Work examples: we have a few data sets with known patterns. The students compute (metrics + barplot) and observe the biodiversity changes and we go through interpretation together. Data sets have to be selected and wrangled in advance.
   - Thursday morning for project presentation
