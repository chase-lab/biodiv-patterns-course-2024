## Part 1. 10am-12pm: What is biodiversity? How do you measure and compare it?

I. Revisit last weeks' tree data (30 minutes)--Brainstorm how to make comparisons

II. Lecture (see ppt) + species accumulation exercise (1,5 hour)

Species accumulation exercise: 
1. Open spreadsheet --https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2WS5dcSathI0MRzNbygU5eWKk67p9N-p_bXx4d73J0/edit?usp=sharing. 
2. Draw random individuals from the bag, one at a time, and note the 'species' in the sheet for your group. You may eat the candy, but there will be a lot more candy this afternoon!
3. See the species accumulation curve develop for each bag. 
4. What community properties determine the shape of the curve? 

## Part 2. 1:00pm-4pm: Discussion and lab excercise

I. Discussion of papers (45 minutes)

II. Lab Excercise 

1. Each student will sample ALL organisms from each of 4 local sites (bags) in a metacommunity (samples will be given at the start of the excercise). Names of species given in ppt.
2. Open up the Google Spreadsheet--https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SGtdU61_3vX43Xtjaq579nEF1xuelRY3Dol2WGKFzUk/edit?usp=sharing
3. Enter data for each 'control' sample in the appropriate place
4. Calculate species richness for each local community (bag)
5. Calculate species richness for each metacommunity (3 bags for each person)
6. Calculate species richness for the entire region (sum of all 4 metacommunities [12 bags total])
7. Draw species accumulatiomn curve at 3 different spatial scales (1 local sample-->3 samples in a metacommunity-->entire region [all 4 metacommunities]) 
8. Explore other summmary variables (i.e., relative abundances, evenness, diversity) at each spatial scale
9. Experimentally impose 'predation' of 50% of individuals by an introduced predator (e.g., raccoons invading Europe). IMPORTANT: Experimental predation must be **random** 
10. Repeat Step #3-7 but with 'impact' data (after predation)
11. Compare species accumulation curves (from step #7) across scales
12. Calculate log ratio effect sizes of species richness loss for each scale (local, metacommunity, region)
