## Part I: Introduction to Functional Diversity and Functional Ecology (10:15 â€“ 12:15)
  
  - Facets of biodiversity, how do they complement taxonomic diversity?
  - Functional ecology and functional diversity (terminology clarification)
  - Functional traits and trait-based approaches
  - How to estimate functional diversity based on traits
  - Exercise: Hill numbers and distance-based approach (trait distinctiveness) to estimate functional trait diversity (Anne Chao et al approach)

## Part II: Estimations of Functional Diversity (13 - 16)

  - Additional estimations of functional diversity: trait-value-based approach
  - Multidimensional trait space and species trait combinations
  - Plant strategies according to their traits
  - Exercise: Functional richness, evenness, dispersion (Blonder et al approach)
